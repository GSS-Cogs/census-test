    "For example, you cannot request all of the geography codes in a single call, the site will time-out or error due to the number of data items. Additionally each call is limited to a maximum of 25k records; hence the need for a few nested programming loops etc. etc. etc.\n",

    "\"*Had a chat with census team this morning and this is the dataset they would like us to test out\n",
    "Its a 2011 census table LC3409EW >> https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/lc3409ew and includes General Health, Tenure and Age, covers England and Wales, and goes down to OA level.\n",
    "obviously its available through the NOMIS API and i would like us to suck that into COGS rather than download and transform. The census team have had some very good feedback from Ahmed on the data viz and sparql and i think this has generated some buzz within the census senior management team. So the idea is to load this data into COGS and have Ahmed do a data viz on it and compare that with the CMD.\n",
    "We have looked at NOMIS API already and i would like us to give consideration on what and when we could get this loaded into COGS.\"*\n",
